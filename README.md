# Facial-Keypoints-Detection
Final project of Data Analysis.

## Introduction
In this project, we are trying to use facial pictures provided in the data set to detect the facial features, primarily to locate the eyes, nose, and mouth. Then classify different expressions on the basis of face localization. Also, we implement some applications using facial keypoint.

We use four models to determine the facial keypoints based on convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, and fully connected deep network. We augment the images, adjust 2 kernel and layers, in order to achieve the purpose of improving accuracy rate. And after that, to implement the results that we have, we use a deep neural network to extract the characteristic relationships between facial keypoints and emotion.
